Machine Learning Churn Prediction System using Python, XGBoost &amp; Power BI

Customer Churn Prediction System

This project is developed as part of **Machine Learning Internship Task 2**.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) using machine learning classification models.

---

 Problem Statement
Customer retention is critical for businesses like telecom, banking, and SaaS.  
This project predicts customer churn probability and identifies key factors driving churn.

---

Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- Contains customer demographics, services used, billing details, and churn status.

---

Tools & Technologies
